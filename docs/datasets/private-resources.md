# Resources

EDS-Scikit contains some resources that are stored *as is*,
either because it comes from manual work, or because its generation might be time and computationally intensive.

!!! aphp "Private data"
    A lot of those resources are specific to AP-HP's CDW, thus are stored on a private repository. If you work on AP-HP's ecosystem, you can install those resources along with `EDS-Scikit` via `pip install 'eds_scikit[aphp]'`.


For each resource listed bellow, you will find:

- A short description
- If relevant, a way to register your function in order to use your own data
- If relevant, a link to the generation function
